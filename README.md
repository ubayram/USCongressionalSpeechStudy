# USCongressionalSpeechStudy

Most of the scripts available in this repository were used in the construction of the "What’s in a Word? Detecting Partisan Affiliation from Word Use in Congressional Speeches" paper. They date back as early as 2017, so the methods are old, new python versions will not be compatible, so please be aware when implementing them.

More details about the methods and the data collection used in this study are available in the paper, which is also provided as pdf in this repo.

If you are using the scripts in this repository or the paper, please cite:
